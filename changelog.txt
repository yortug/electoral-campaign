====================
Processing.py
  1. removed CSV module dependency
   - replaced readCSV() with readCSV2()
   - changed csv write process in resultsMenu()
   - changed csv write process in marginalResultsMenu()
   - changed csv write process in marginalCampaignMenu()

marginalCampaign.py
  1. removed CSV module dependency
   - replaced readCSV() to readCSV2()
  2. found error in total time formatting for .txt output
   - added missing '%24'

make_australia.py
  1. removed CSV module dependency
   - replaced readCSV() to readCSV2()
  2. found "shooters, fishers and farmers" error
   - changed index from 13 to -2 (negative indexing side-steps the problem)

australia.pickle
  1. updated after "shooters, fishers and farmers" error fix
   - remade australia.pickle using make_australia.py 

clean_data.py
  1. removed CSV module dependency
   - replaced readCSV() to readCSV2()
  2. found a None check iteration error
   - changed "if array == None" to "if np.any(array == None)"

airport_dist_clean.pickle
  1. updated after None check iteration error fix
   - remade airport_dist_clean.pickle using clean_data.py

electorate_dist_clean.pickle
  1. updated after None check iteration error fix
   - remade electorate_dist_clean.pickle using clean_data.py

/data_structures/DSAGraph.py
  1. removed simple sorted() function dependency (forgot to remove after testing)
   - simple cases were just a switch from "sorted()" to "DSASorts().insertionSort()"
  2. removed more complex sorted() (lambda function) dependency
   - this was being used in my Kruskal's algorithm as a placeholder
   - WAS necessary because didn't have a way to solve objects by their attributes
   - but made edgeSort() function and edited Kruskal's to work with that instead

/data_structures/DSASorts.py
  1. added edgeSort() function
   - was necessary to get rid of complex sorted() dependency in my Kruskal's algorithm

/data_structures/DSASorts_test1.py
  1. created this file
   - simple look at some basic testing I did when implementing edgeSort() function
